# âœ¨ It's official.
I am pleased to announce that I have made the decision to transition to GitLab. After experiencing increasing frustration with GitHub, I have determined that GitLab aligns more closely with both my personal preferences and the practices of my organization, Cryptic, headquartered at https://crypticchat.xyz.
As our entire company has migrated to GitLab, I believe it is appropriate for me to do the same. You can find my GitLab profile by visiting https://gitlab.com/carsonfromcryptic.

Thank you, and farewell. ðŸ‘‹
