# âœ¨ It's official. Goodbye
I am excited to announce that I have decided to transition to GitLab. After growing increasingly frustrated with GitHub, I found that GitLab better suits both my personal preferences and the practices of my organization, Cryptic, headquartered at https://crypticchat.xyz.
Since our entire company has moved to GitLab, it makes sense for me to follow suit. You can now find my GitLab profile at https://gitlab.com/carsonfromcryptic.

P.S. For those wondering, I will still use this GitHub account for projects that are exclusively hosted here, though I prefer GitLab.
Thank you, and farewell. ðŸ‘‹
